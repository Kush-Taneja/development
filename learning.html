<!--MY LEARNING-->

<!-- There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. -->
<!-- 
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, 
which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels): -->

<!-- The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies 
an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. 
This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. -->


<!-- Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

Example
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1> -->


<!-- HTML Display
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed -->
.

<!-- Example
<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains         a lot of spaces
in the source         code,
but the        browser
ignores it.
</p> -->

<!-- Solution - The HTML <pre> Element
   The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
   
   The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier),
       and it preserves both spaces and line breaks: -->

<!-- HTML Horizontal Rules (sief ek hori line kheech dega)

<!-- HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph: -->

Use font-family for text fonts
Use font-size for text sizes
Use text-align for text alignment -->

<!-- HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text highlight 
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text  in sab me text se phle or last me use tags-->

   <!-- The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p> -->

<!-- The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

   A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph. -->
   <!-- HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

Example
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p> -->

<!-- Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p> -->

<!-- ext Alignment
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p> -->
